This is a STAR-generated dApp created from Sanity content and templates.

## Project Details

- **Template**: {config.get('projectName', 'Unknown')}
- **Content Type**: {config.get('contentType', 'Unknown')}
- **Platform**: {config.get('platform', 'web')}
- **Generated**: {config.get('generatedAt', 'Unknown')}

## Features

- OASIS Avatar Integration
- Wallet Support: {', '.join(config.get('walletIntegration', {}).get('supportedChains', []))}
- Interactive Features: {', '.join(config.get('interactiveFeatures', []))}

## Quick Start

### Local Development
```bash
cd {project_info['project_path']}
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Build for production
dotnet publish -c Release

# Run the published app
dotnet bin/Release/net8.0/publish/{project_name}.dll
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t {project_name.lower().replace(' ', '-')} .

# Run container
docker run -p 5000:80 {project_name.lower().replace(' ', '-')}
```

## OASIS Integration

This dApp integrates with the OASIS platform for:
- Avatar authentication
- Wallet transactions
- Content management
- Cross-chain interoperability

## Support

For support, visit the OASIS platform documentation.
